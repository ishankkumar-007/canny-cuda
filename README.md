# Canny Edge Detector - CUDA Parallel code

This is my parallel CUDA implementation of Canny's Edge Detection algorithm.

## Usage
Using the program is fairly simple. Start by downloading or cloning the repo. I already have two sample images that can be used, however, you can use your own pictures. Just make sure to copy them into the "input_images" folder and that they're in the .pgm format.
